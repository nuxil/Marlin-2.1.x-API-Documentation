# Marlin-2.1.x-API-Documentation
Marlin-2.1.x_API_Documentation

The Documentation was made using Doxygen.
Due to the amount of preprocessing and macros used in marlin there might be some errors.
Also, not all functions are documented well. so yeah..
The documentation should reflect the api used in Marlin 2.1.x Bugfix.

To view the documentation open index.html
Have fun.
